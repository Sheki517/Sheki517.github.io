          Iâ€™m a sophomore at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I am passionate about 
          solving real-world problems through technology. My experience includes software development, data analysis, 
          and economic research.

          One of the most impactful projects I've worked on is a web-based application to support victims of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in Kikuyu, Kenya. 
          The app, built using Django, provides a secure platform where victims can anonymously report incidents of violence, ensuring their privacy and safety. 
          The application integrates with local support services to connect victims with counseling, legal aid, and medical resources. 
          Its design prioritized ease of use for people with varying levels of tech literacy, while ensuring data security was at the forefront. 
          This project was deeply fulfilling, as it helped create a lifeline for people in need and provided a real-world solution for a serious issue.

            Additionally, I worked on a fun personal project while in my college freshman year. I developed a 2D arcade game called "Alien Invaders" 
            using Python. This game incorporated mechanics for alien movement, player controls, and collision detection. It was an exciting challenge 
            that tested my game development skills and allowed me to apply object-oriented programming principles in a creative context. I also gained experience in data analysis during my internship at the Economic Policy Research 
          Center in Kenya, where I developed predictive models and visualized fiscal reforms' impact on SMEs using Python.
